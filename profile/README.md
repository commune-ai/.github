## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are an organization focused on building a Protocol and Market System for Incentive-driven Coordination of Decentralized AI. Our goal is to create a fully community-driven ecosystem with no bureaucracy, team, or premine. We believe in the power of code and contributors.

🌈 To get involved and contribute to our project, you can start by installing our lightweight library, [CommuneX](https://github.com/agicommies/communex), which serves as an alternative to the original Commune Ai codebase. CommuneX is designed for simplicity and scalable development.

👩‍💻 For a comprehensive understanding of our ecosystem, please refer to our [documentation](https://communeai.org/docs/getting-started/intro). It will guide you through the different components and how they work together.

🧙 Our blockchain node is written in Rust and built on the Substrate framework. You can explore the codebase and contribute to its development [here](https://github.com/commune-ai/subspace).

🍿 Fun fact: We believe in open-source collaboration's power and decentralized AI's magic!

If you prefer working with the original Python library and SDK, you can find it [here](https://github.com/commune-ai/commune).

We welcome contributions from the community and look forward to building a decentralized AI ecosystem together!
